# Evaluation
This document aims to provide details on how to evaluate the product, first from a user experience point of view, and then from a technical point of view.

<div align="center"><img src="./img/kpi.png" width="600" /></div>

We based our evaluation model in the well known **Key Performance Indicators**. The generic identikit of the KPIs must meet certain characteristics: the indicators must be ***quantifiable*** (and therefore measurable); ***management***, i.e. they must indicate whether the company is growing or not; ***operational***, and therefore exercise an effective change in the strategy adopted; finally ***practical***, and therefore adaptable to business needs.

## <a id="usex"></a>User experience

#### Users survey
To first evaluate the idea, we have used a survey, sharing it with our family, friends, and friends of friends. Indeed, by these feedbacks and suggestions, we (hopefully) understood where to make some changes, and especially if the final user would really like and possibly use the final service.

Here the anonymous results:
- [International](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15IgMSvd-63VwI2cXw7SHC1U36O2IEgHQvG_yR56Y7Nk/edit#gid=675511585)
- [Italian](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EfuZT_q8hNwSY7gu_bXCDNayzk7qYUeNwSBV3rvE9xY/edit#gid=510814664)

Here the most relevant graphs:
- [International](./pdf/graph_international.pdf)
- [Italian](./pdf/graph_Italy.pdf)


We received more than 100 replies from Italian people, and more than 40 from people spread over 15 different countries.
| | Result |
|----|----|
1 | Over 90% of them believe this service would be useful to improve the learning of the fundamental characteristics of a work of art, help the museum to provide a better service, boost their curiosity, and would have fun trying the application.
2 | The same percentage of people would go to the museum to try the novelty, however, in Italy, only around 50% if they have already been there, while in the other countries this percentage increases to ~65%.
3 | Finally, over 80% of these people told us they are thinking to download for real our application on their smartphone.

#### Evaluation metrics
Now, let's define the parameters we will use for the final evaluation:
* **Accessibility**: any type of user who knows how to use a chat will be able to use Ablativo.
* **Simplicity**: Ablativo must be intuitive. 
    * The museum visitor can easily sign-in/sign-up and choose his/her mentor
    * The museum visitor can easily interact with the mentor, which will have as natural as possible human-like behavior
    * The museum visitor can easily interact with the statutes, which will have as natural as possible human-like behavior
    * The museum curator can easily understand and see the statistics of the metrics collected by the service
* **Usability**: The response times of the chat must be rapid, otherwise this may lead the user to not use it
* **Graphic interface**: The interaction between the mentor and the works of art will seem as natural as possible. The overall interface must be user friendly.
* **Privacy & Security**: Ablativo doesn't store any type of sensible data, the passwords will be encrypted.

Glossary:

* ⚠️ Work in progress
* 🔜 For the future

### Environmental sensors measurements
* **Ambient sensors**: Let's assume we have N rooms inside the museum. We will put one STM board per room. The board has `Temperature`, `Humidity`, and `Pressure` sensors. Moreover, is works as a `Beacon`.
    * *2nd Delivery*: Temperature and Humidity sensors are simulated with a JS script that generates random values and sends them to the cloud and to the backend of the application. We send the values every 5-10 minutes.
    Beacon will be simulated with a smartphone through the app [Beacon Simulator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.alea.beaconsimulator&hl=en)

    * *3rd Delivery*: The sensors will be real and so the beacon.

* **Smartphone sensors**: we retrieve the values from the smartphone sensors of every user. These values are real.
    * *3rd Delivery*: we will be able to collect the values with a frequency of 1Hz (1 message per second). The values will be grouped and sent periodically

* **Heart Rate sensor**:
    * *2nd Delivery*: The values will be simulated with a JS script that with a frequency of 1Hz generates random values and send them to the cloud and to the backend of the application.
    * *3rd Delivery*: This sensor will be possibly real. To do this we have 2 options: Smartphone Heart Rate sensor or Bend Heart Rate sensor.

**NOTE**: The simulated version of the sensors allow us to check the connection between the BackEnd of the application and the AWS Backend.

### Beacon-Sensors board
Our analysis is based on some specific metrics: `Accessibility`, `Accuracy`, `Complexity`, `Robustness`, `Cost`, `Scalability`, `Security`. Together with these, depending on the component taken into consideration, there will be some more specific characteristics.


##### Metrics description
* **Accessibility**: indicates the ability of the technology to be exploited by the user.
* **Robustness**: the system's ability to resist interference and noise from nearby sensors
* **Scalability**: the scalability of a system ensures its normal operation even when the sphere of the application becomes larger.
* **Cost**: the cost of a system like this can depend on several factors. The most important ones include money, time, space, weight, and energy. The time factor is linked to installation and maintenance times.
* **Security**: security means the danger that data sent through the system will be violated or accessed by third parties.
* **Failure detection**: the system must be able to notify the museum if there is a fault.

##### Metrics evaluation
| Metrics | Status |Solution/Result |
| ------------- |:---:| :-----|
| `Accessibility` | ✅ | Battery-powered that can last up to 2 years, they can be placed on any surface, accessible from the mobile app |
| `Robustness` | ✅ | Strategic points where to place the sensor. 1 beacon per room instead of 1 beacon per statue
| `Scalability` | ✅ | Beacons transmit only output signals 
| `Cost` | ⚠️ | Cost of sensors + Cost of the AWS infrastructure (see [Architecture](./Architecture.md) section for more details) |
| `Security` | ✅ | Beacons transmit output signals, there is no intrinsic safety risk in the transmission. However, all the transmission are still encrypted and signed |
| `Failure detection` | ✅ | The AWS IoT Core service gives the ability to check the status of the connect devices and therefore disconnections |


### Mobile app - Web dashboard
##### Metrics description
* **Accessibility**: indicates the ability of the technology to be exploited by the user.
* **Accuracy**: average error in calculating the distance from the statues (only for app) .
* **Precision**: how the system works overtime, how similar the various measurements are to each other, which does not necessarily mean that the system is accurate (only for app) .
* **Complexity**: complexity can be attributed to hardware, software needed for the system.
* **Scalability**: the scalability of a system ensures its normal operation even when the sphere of the application becomes larger.
* **Cost**: the cost of a system like this can depend on several factors. The most important ones include money, time, space, weight, and energy.
* **Security**: security means the danger that data sent through the system will be violated or accessed by third parties.

##### Metrics evaluation
| Metrics | Status |Solution/Result |
| ------------- |:---:| :----- |
| `Accessibility` | ✅ | Accessible with a simple smartphone - computer |
| `Accuracy` | ⚠️ | Calculated as the average of the Euclidean distance between the estimated and the real position |
| `Precision` | ⚠️ | Comparison of the various measurements |
| `Complexity` | ✅ | Thanks to the React and React native framework the implementation is very simple and fast |
| `Scalability` | ✅ | Being designed for an internal museum, it will have a number of connected users that will never be too high to affect scalability |
| `Cost` | ✅ | Related to the previous table |
| `Security` | ✅ | All data provided by the users are encrypted. No sensible data needed |
