# Evaluation
This document aims to provide details on how to evaluate the product, first from a user experience point of view, and then from a technical point of view.

<div align="center"><img src="./img/kpi.png" width="600" /></div>

We based our evaluation model in the well known **Key Performance Indicators**. The generic identikit of the KPIs must meet certain characteristics: the indicators must be ***quantifiable*** (and therefore measurable); ***management***, i.e. they must indicate whether the company is growing or not; ***operational***, and therefore exercise an effective change in the strategy adopted; finally ***practical***, and therefore adaptable to business needs.

## <a id="usex"></a>User experience

#### Users survey
To first evaluate the idea, we have used a survey, sharing it with our family, friends, and friends of friends. Indeed, by these feedbacks and suggestions, we (hopefully) understood where to make some changes, and especially if the final user would really like and possibly use the final service.

Here the anonymous results:
- [International](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15IgMSvd-63VwI2cXw7SHC1U36O2IEgHQvG_yR56Y7Nk/edit#gid=675511585)
- [Italian](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EfuZT_q8hNwSY7gu_bXCDNayzk7qYUeNwSBV3rvE9xY/edit#gid=510814664)

Here the most relevant graphs:
- [International](./pdf/graph_international.pdf)
- [Italian](./pdf/graph_Italy.pdf)


We received more than 100 replies from Italian people, and more than 40 from people spread over 15 different countries.
| | Result |
|----|----|
1 | Over 90% of them believe this service would be useful to improve the learning of the fundamental characteristics of a work of art, help the museum to provide a better service, boost their curiosity, and would have fun trying the application.
2 | The same percentage of people would go to the museum to try the novelty, however, in Italy, only around 50% if they have already been there, while in the other countries this percentage increases to ~65%.
3 | Finally, over 80% of these people told us they are thinking to download for real our application on their smartphone.

#### Evaluation metrics
Now, let's define the parameters for the final evaluation:
* **Accessibility**: any type of user who knows how to use a chat must be able to use Ablativo.
* **Simplicity**: Ablativo must be intuitive. 
    * The museum visitor can easily sign-in/sign-up and choose his/her mentor;
    * The museum visitor can easily interact with the mentor/statue, which must provide an extensive set of questions;
    * The museum curator can easily understand and see the statistics of the metrics collected by the service;
* **Usability**: The response times of the chat must be rapid, otherwise this may lead the user to not use the application.
* **Graphic interface**: The overall interface must be user friendly and pleasant.
* **Privacy & Security**: Ablativo does not store any sensible data. The passwords are hashed as for standard requirements.

## <a id="tech"></a>Technical aspects

Let's analyse the Technical aspects through the edge components that interface directly with the user. Here the status glossary:
* ✅ Completed
* ⚠️ Work in progress
* 🔜 For the future

### Sensors measurements overview
The list of all the sensors we are using in our application.
* **Ambient sensors**: Let's assume we have N rooms inside the museum, we will put one STM board per room. Each board has `Temperature`, `Humidity`, and `Pressure` sensors. Moreover, it works as a `Beacon`.

* **Smartphone sensors**: We retrieve the values from the smartphone sensors of every user. These values are real. We are able to collect the values with a frequency of 1Hz (1 message per second), so the values are grouped and sent periodically.

* **Heart Rate sensor**: For the PoC, the values are simulated with a JS script that (with a frequency of 1Hz) generates random values and sends them to the cloud and to the backend of the application.




### Beacon-Sensors board

##### Metrics description
* **Accessibility**: indicates the ability of the technology to be exploited by the user.
* **Robustness**: the system's ability to resist interference and noise from nearby sensors
* **Scalability**: the scalability of a system ensures its normal operation even when the sphere of the application becomes larger.
* **Cost**: the cost of a system like this can depend on several factors. The most important ones include money, time, space, weight, and energy. The time factor is linked to installation and maintenance times.
* **Security**: security means the danger that data sent through the system will be violated or accessed by third parties.
* **Failure detection**: the system must be able to notify the museum if there is a fault.

##### Metrics evaluation
| Metrics | Status |Solution/Result |
| ------------- |:---:| :-----|
| `Accessibility` | ✅ | Battery-powered, the board can last up to 2 years. The devices can be placed on any surface accessible from the mobile app. |
| `Robustness` | ✅ | Strategic points where to place the sensor. We have 1 beacon per room instead of 1 beacon per statue.
| `Scalability` | ✅ | Beacons transmit only constant output signals, which do not change with the number of devices.
| `Cost` | ✅ | The cost of the sensors depends on the model but in general is about few euros  |
| `Security` | ✅ | The beacon transmits only output signals, thus there is no intrinsic safety risk in the transmission. All the interactions with the cloud are encrypted and signed to ensure authenticity. |
| `Failure detection` | ✅ | The AWS IoT Core service gives the ability to check the status of the connect devices and therefore disconnections. |


### Mobile app
##### Metrics description
* **Accessibility**: indicates the ability of the technology to be exploited by the user.
* **Accuracy**: average error in calculating the distance from the statues.
* **Precision**: how the system works overtime, how similar the various measurements are to each other, which does not necessarily mean that the system is accurate.
* **Complexity**: complexity can be attributed to hardware, software needed for the system.
* **Scalability**: the scalability of a system ensures its normal operation even when the sphere of the application becomes larger.
* **Cost**: the cost of a system like this can depend on several factors. The most important ones include money, time, space, weight, and energy.
* **Security**: security means the danger that data sent through the system will be violated or accessed by third parties.

##### Metrics evaluation
| Metrics | Status |Solution/Result |
| ------------- |:---:| :----- |
| `Accessibility` | ✅ | Accessible with a any smartphone, both IOS and Android|
| `Accuracy` | ⚠️ | Calculated as the average of the Euclidean distance between the estimated and the real position |
| `Precision` | ⚠️ | Comparison of the various measurements |
| `Complexity` | ✅ | Thanks to the React native framework the implementation is very simple and fast |
| `Scalability` | ✅ | The AWS cloud infrastructure ensures there is always enough computing power |
| `Cost` | ✅ | Some fees may be applied by the App stores |
| `Security` | ✅ | All data provided by the users are encrypted. No sensible data needed |

##### Accuracy and Precision in details
